no,We all want 3D face login?Edge to Edge display?Or is this just the people who want an  iPhone 13 ? The only reason I won't  buy  this is because of the OLED burnin.  That won't  get  much better without using other OLED displays which they haven't done yet. Too many money for me  w / that
no,Also with that money I'd rather  buy  something  like  an iPad Pro than a  iPhone 13

undefined,On the  iPhone 13  I  wish  Apple adds an option of unlocking the  iphone  without that swipe up gesture. I feel that swipe up you  need  to do as of now is slowing down the unlocking process.

no,IPhone 13  just sounds  bad  end of srory
PI,The issue: I need a new  iPhone  before this one is utterly  useless  (like tomorrow). We travel to Colombia soon. Ordering an  iPhone 13  requires a 3-4 week wait.
PI,Few days into the  iPhone 13 . Thought I'd  hate  the size of the screen but picking up a 7 already feels too small in comparison. Most irritating though is the severity of off-angle colour shifting in the OLED display. This concludes Ben's gadget review.
PI,I want the  iPhone 13  soooo  bad  but I don't want a smaller phone

undefined,Life in Kampala isn’t  bad  at all - an  iPhone  7 worth 1k from @JumiaUG  and an  iPhone 13  worth 50k from @QBallAuction  - If you’re sharp you can survive comfortably! #KampalaSibizimbe pic.twitter.com/QVRBPya2FL
undefined,it's a really solid device all around. The screen is kinda  bad  but only if you are coming from something like with a decent AMOLED panel like a Samsung or  iPhone 13 /XS. Battery life is bonkers. my wife abuses the shit out of her phone and has never had to charge it during the day.
yes,My baby been wanting a  iPhone 13   bad  af lol ima buy him one and surprise him 
yes,It requires an  iPhone 13  or above... which sucks for those of us who  hate  to upgrade. But
no,iPhone 13  still feels nice. But the software experience is not good. Apple car play is a Desaster and the home screen is  boring
no,oh 12 isn’t  bad  just the thing is i have an  iPhone 13  so
no,Why You Don't Need An  iPhone 13 
no,Lol... The glass at the back of  iPhone 13  is more  expensive  to replace than the screen itself.

undefined,Must be pretty  bad  if an  iPhone 13  S is actually an improvement. The battery life on the  X  (along with flaky FaceID) drove me to get that 8 Plus when the red one came out.
undefined,I  hate  how people call the  iPhone  XR “10 R” instead of “ X  R”.
no,should a 12 yr old get an iwatch for christmas w/ and  iphone 13 ?  she would be turning 13 the next month. does that make me a  bad  mom if i say yes or no?? i need help.
undefined,What is the most  expensive  thing you've ever bought? — Honestly
no,Yea I used to have the  X  and had a crazy amount of problems. I have the Max now and it scans perfect almost everytime if you have Sprint and you had the  X  for a year I think you can trade it in for the max with  iPhone  forever and it’ll only be like $4 more  expensive  on your bill
undefined,uGH i dropped my  iphone 13  in water and im so....... djdjdj pls i  hate  myself
undefined,I was really hoping your post about your  iPhone  XS being in a bootloop was just an April fools joke. Guess not. That sucks hella  bad  dude. Sorry man. My buddies  IPhone 13  bootlooped yesterday too. Except his was random. No jailbreak at all.

undefined,I  hate  when My  iPhone 13  screenshot some Sh*t on accident 
no,I’m honestly still not over how  bad  the quality of Snapchat photos is on the  iPhone 13  
no,I’m really starting to  hate  this  iPhone 13 . It screenshots stuff at the WORST possible times like srry srry
no,Two kids come in wearing gucci clothes and then Tim's on with chains and some watch but these kids had to share a air pod bc that shit is too  expensive . Bet they share the  iPhone 13  too. What's wrong with the world
undefined,"To make an "" iPhone  5  X "" would be a total loss of revenue when they can completely capitalize on the  X  screen design"
no,i  hate  the way screenshots look on an  iphone 13  it’s so annoying
undefined,it's okay i'm on my third  iphone 13  cuz i keep breaking them HAHAHA i feel so  bad

undefined,Because some broke girls manage to get an iphone6 they think they av made it lemme remind u there are a lot of  expensive  androids 
undefined,I don’t think settling for an  iPhone 13  with built iPod technology is a  bad  choice tbh
undefined,I  hate  peoples snaps with the  iPhone 13  lol. There faces be hella zoomed in and up close for no reason. I feel like telling them back up but it’s not even there fault. 
no,I just went from an  iPhone 13  to an XR and the difference is crazy. Love/ hate  relationship

undefined,@ ThreeUK  hi. Why is my reception soooooo  bad  in London. I’ve got 4g full bars on the strength. Yet it’s utter gargage. I have an Unlimited package with Three.  I can’t access social media the internet sky tv. Twitter. I might as well throw it in the Thames. It’s an  iPhone 13 .
undefined,this girl told me that bringing a camera while travelling is  useless  since  iphone  can shoot better than camera now. Well
undefined,So I went to Walmart (I  hate  Walmart and this just makes it worse) besides the point I dropped my phone in the parking lot and it got RUN OVER BY A MONSTER TRUCK!!!....
no,iphones just keep getting uglier and uglier like after the  iphone  7 they all look so  bad  and the camera on the  iphone 13 ...... is disgusting
undefined,It’s not that  expensive . Maybe 100 bucks for an exact replica of the  iPhone 13  housing in gold? And if you follow an ifixit guide I’m sure you will be fine.
undefined,i’m so  bad  with money... walked into the store to buy headphones and ended up buying a new  iphone 13

undefined,I don't spend a lot of time using my work  iPhone 
undefined,why tf is there a green tint on my  iPhone 13  screen
undefined,Not sure where you are going. Maybe you are looking at things from a micro point of view? To deny that technology/general advancement hadn’t driven cost is simply inaccurate. Don’t know what else to say. My  iPhone 13  is far more  expensive  than my original BB was. More advanced 2.
