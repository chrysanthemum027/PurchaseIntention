no,@ Apple  @AppleSupport  I really  hate  the fact that I spent all this money on the  iPhone 13  for the camera to be so trashy! The @SamsungMobile  phoneâ€™s camera is so much better. You guys really disappointed me.
no,so in order to download a video from my  iphone  I first need to update iTunes which cannot be updated until I update the version of OS  X  that I'm running. This is why people  hate  computers

no,I  hate  that  iPhone  XR
no,@ Apple  I downloaded the latest update for my  iPhone 13  and now itâ€™s a  useless  brick. The battery is supped up twice as fast or more. Iâ€™m having to charge it 3 times a day now instead of once. I thought youâ€™d given this game up?? #battery  #iPhone 13  #iphone  #apple   #batterylife
no,is my  iphone 13  the only one that sometimes has the sc image quality at like 420p why is it so  bad  sometimes

no,@ AppleSupport  I  hate  my  iphone 13  and my wife does too. Why does it take longer to unlock the  iphone 13  with facial recognition and having to swipe up. Than with  iphone  7 plus with thumb print recognition and no swiping up. It doesnt make sense for newer technology to be slower.

no,The one crisis I have with that is  iPhone 13  only has one lightning port so if I need to also charge it with my portacharger on the go im screwed lol apple is ruining all their shit first that then the new macbooks are terrible with falling apart keyboards and a  useless  touch bar

no,I was at a lunch and looked around to notice that of 10 people... only one had upgraded to the  iPhone 13  and it kind of hit me... how  bad  are apples  iphone  sales right now that they basically have to go all in on a netflix clone streaming service...  $ appl

no,Same Iâ€™d  hate  to have this phone ( iPhone 13 ) and get absolutely nothing should be like a bundle but without the vbucks included if you get what I mean

no,change to A5... seems decent tho.  iPhone 13  is too  expensive  ;(
no,Oh really? As far as I'm aware the  Iphone  7-8+ X -Xr-XS-XS got increasingly  expensive  as each new model released. Sure it went down eventually
no,I have  iPhone 13 . I started with android HTC Droid 1 & 2 and have since been iOS for  8+ years. Contemplating a switch to Samsung s10 or s10e.

no,To create new airpods which re so simular to the old ones spending on this a few years. Apple disappointed fisrt when released the last one  iphone  XS which is so simular to the  X  one but much more  expensive  and closed  X  one trading.
no,I was surprised it has the latest processor.  Plus the apple pencil.  I like the feel of the newer apple pencil in my hand since it is squared off but you canâ€™t have everything.  I  hate  face id on my  iPhone 13 .  Half the time I hold it too close and it fails.
